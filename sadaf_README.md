Snake and ladder file
To make a snake and ladder game I didn't use pygame……
I used text based method for this file
# import sys
# import time
# import random
I created and defined different functions
Functions for ladder ,snake ,for players,for start and for exit
With using functions and conditions and loop I created Snake and Ladder game
I had created functions in which start function is there ,the game starts as you press run button they will ask you to input the name of the players ,when you give them the names they will ask you to enter button ,the dice will move by random choice  ,dice will range from 1-6 and Maximum is 100
When you reach at 100 you will win.
To reach to your final destination your dice will move and according to the number display at dice and your position will love according to that means you start the game at 0 position,
You get a new score so you will get  old position and current position
And your position moves according to that,
And ladder is there according to that when you reach the position ladder is there ladder will take you up , Snake bite is also there as you reach the position snake will bite you.i made this using dictionary where key and value is there ,you reach the key and you get the position according to that.
